## RomCom
Mod 1 Pair-Project
Leigh Larson & Jordy Shryock

# Objective

Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data. Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword. Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM. Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements. Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS.

# Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well ... maybe that's true. We're going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!

# Planning
This pair project will use Atom as a text editor, GitHub projects as the project management tool (https://github.com/users/jordy1611/projects/1), MDN and lesson plans as references, and the employment of mentors for code feedback, guidance, and the "rubber duck" code comprehension method.

This is a 6-day project. The estimated timeline is:
* Tuesday: DTR, review spec and set up guidelines, Begin Iteration 0
* Wednesday: Iteration 0 completed
* Thursday: Iteration 1 completed
* Friday: Iteration 2 completed
* Saturday: Iteration 3 completed
* Sunday: Iteration 4 completed
* Monday: Iteration 5 completed
* Tuesday: Extensions and Project Refinement
